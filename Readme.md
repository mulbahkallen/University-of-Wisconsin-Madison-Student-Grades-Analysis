# University of Wisconsin, Madison Student Grades Analysis 
-- Project Status: [Completed]

## Data Description
The University of Wisconsin - Madison publishes reports for all courses (and sections of these courses), instructors, subjects, and grade reports for each section for every Fall and Spring semester since 2006.

There are more than 9,000 courses in this dataset. There are nearly 200,000-course sections with grades, with 3 million grades reported in total. 18,000 instructors are included in the dataset, all of whom are associated with various sections that may or may not have grades reported for them.

Download the data [here](https://www.kaggle.com/Madgrades/uw-madison-courses) and put it in a new folder named `input`
The data is provided by EDU INC - Improving Education Through Analytics and the University of Wisconsin, Madison.
